         I run mostly on the lakefront path, where throughout the year I have the opportunity to appreciate the tranquility of the  city front often with few others.  During this particularly harsh winter, I had many runs on the path without seeing anyone.

            In January, we had one of the coldest days on record with a negative thirty wind chill. I wasn't brave enough to head out 		  but for a few minutes.  But on one of the few days when it popped above zero, I was able to see what the lake looked like 		frozen to as far as I could see.

          By February, I became accustomed to wearing as many layers as possible. I wasn't able to run outdoors as much as I would 		have liked but I was able to squeeze in several long runs when the temperature allowed. As hard as the Winter was, it was 		pretty neat to see the frozen landscape of the city and the effect the weather had on everything surrounding me.     </div>
