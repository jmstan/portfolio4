        This past February, we went up to Bayfield, Wisconsin to cross country ski and to visit Madeline Island. 
        The road froze about three feet deep and had opened the previous week before we arrived. There are only a handful of people that live on the island during the Winter. Everything was closed except one coffee shop. We spent some time on the ice road watching people drive back and forth, including a small school bus.

            The windchill felt about 20 below, but the ice road had the most traffic within a few miles. They have an ice boat which is only used for emergencies. The ice was snow packed and made it easier to drive on. When you first get on the ice, there is a big crack between land and ice with cones aligned to guide you where to drive. Other areas farther out, were guarded to know that it is unsafe to drive. Ice huts were commmon with cars driving to them. The views on the island seemed endless.

          It felt like we were in Alaska, as you could see people going from island to land for groceries. There were only three restaurants, a coffee shop, and a grocery store open. Bayfield is located at the most the northern part of Wisconsin, surrounded by Lake Superior. We stayed in a coach house that had heated flooring and kept the space warm.

        On the island, we didn't see any cars. The radius is only 3 miles. We had to drive slow because there were so many deer running around. All the homes look abandoned and all the roads and trees iced over.
