        This past February, we went up to Bayfield, Wisconsin to cross country ski and to go to Madeline Island. 
        The road froze about three feet deep and the ice road to the island had opened the previous week before we arrived. There are only a handful of people that live on the island during the Winter and we could only we one coffee shop that was open. We spent some time on the island watching people drive back and forth, including a small school bus.

            The windchill felt about 20 below, but the ice road had the most traffic within a few miles. They have an ice boat which is only used for emergencies. The ice was snow packed and made it easier to drive on. When you first get on the ice, there is a big crack between land and ice with cones aligned to guide you where to drive. Other areas farther out, were guarded to know that it is unsafe to drive. Ice huts were commmon with cars driving to them. The views on the island seemed endless.

          By February, I became accustomed to wearing as many layers as possible. I wasn't able to run outdoors as much as I would 		have liked but I was able to squeeze in several long runs when the temperature allowed. As hard as the Winter was, it was 		pretty neat to see the frozen landscape of the city and the effect the weather had on everything surrounding me.     </div>
