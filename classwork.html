              <p class="inline-text">  <span class="head1"> Hackathon Version 1</span> <br> For the first assignment, I chose to make an invite for a local Hackathon. I thought about main elements I wanted to include such as a map or landscape image to get a feeling of where the event is being held. I also wanted the  text to feel game like and chose a sans-serif typeface. With a grid, I started laying out content and tried multiple colors to play off the background image. I emphasized important parts of the text with font weight and bolder colors.

                  I realized the background image was too distracting and the typeface colors were not working to convey the feeling I wanted. I decided 
                  to start over without a background image. Red and orange seeemed like better color choices to use. I also changed typefaces and focused on the placement of words, changing the sizes and spacing.

              <p class="inline-text">  <span class="head1"> Polaroid  Version 1 </span> <br> The next assignment was to sell something you own. The polaroid camera was a perfect idea to play off their brand colors. I created a background pattern with these colors and tried a variety of ways to incorporate it with the header. Then, I made a gallery of images to show off what the camera looks like and what kind of images it takes.   </p>

              <p class="inline-text2">  <span class="head1"> Polaroid  Version 2 </span> <br> I wanted the page to be easier to read, and the layout to have more breathing room within each block of text. I liked the background pattern, but didn't feel like it was balancing the header. I decided to get rid of the main gallery and display the images with a block of text next to it, to make it simpler to read. Then I added a gallery to the footer to show sample images.</p>

                  For the editorial page, I wanted an article that allowed me to experiment with font size and color. I thought a gallery promo 
                  would work well for this. I made the header typeface huge and the secondary header's smaller to contrast it. I used bold background                     colors and broke the article in three columns for easier reading on the web.            </p>

                  I wanted to break the linear spacing so I overlapped the first three blocks. Next, I wanted the article paragraphs to be displayed 
                  at a longer width with quotes or images next to each paragraph. I used different width sizes to make the reading more appealing.
