		<p class="casestudy-about"> An online printing site specializing in giclee printing utilizing a one page, minimal
		 site. Using monochromatic colors and black and white images, I built this responsive site using a grid, svg icons, and specialized typefaces.  The purpose of this site is to highlight the photographs.

        <p class="casestudy-about">  
		 By having the site mostly in black and white, the focus can be on the subtly of the images. A hint of color was added to make the site feel neutral and make the work stand out. The logo is inspired by fine art photography magazines, a classic and modern feel.
