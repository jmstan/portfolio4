		 <h4 class="casestudy-title"> Paper and Ink </h4>
			<p class="casestudy-about2">An online printing site specializing in gicl√©e printing. Using monochromatic colors and black and white images, I built this responsive site using a grid, svg icons, and specialized typefaces. The purpose of the design is to highlight the photographs. Utilizing mostly in black and white, the focus remains on the images. A hint of color was added to make the site maintain a neutral look and make the work stand out. The logo is inspired by fine art photography magazines, a classic and modern feel.
