		 <h2 class="casestudy-title"> Paper and Ink </h2>
			<p class="casestudy-about2"> An online printing site specializing in giclee printing utilizing a one page, minimal site. Using monochromatic colors and black and white images, I built this responsive site using a grid, svg icons, and specialized typefaces.  The purpose of this site is to highlight the photographs.  By having the site mostly in black and white, the focus can be on the subtly of the images. A hint of color was added to make the site feel neutral and make the work stand out. The logo is inspired by fine art photography magazines, a classic and modern feel.
